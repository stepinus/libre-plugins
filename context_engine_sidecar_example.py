"""Reference LibreFang context-engine sidecar (dependency-free).

Speaks the newline-delimited JSON request/reply protocol described in
docs/architecture/sidecar-context-engine.md. This reference recalls no
memories and trims the window to its most recent slice; replace the bodies
of `ingest` / `assemble` / `after_turn` with your own policy.

Wire it up:

    [context_engine]
    engine = "sidecar"

    [context_engine.sidecar]
    command = "python3"
    args = ["/path/to/context_engine_sidecar.py"]

Two stdio pitfalls this avoids:
  * read with readline(), not `for line in sys.stdin` (the latter
    read-ahead-buffers and would not yield a single line until EOF);
  * flush after every reply (a long-lived process's stdout is block-buffered
    when it is a pipe, so the reply would never reach the daemon otherwise).
